# Character Management Program for FC24 (Arrays)

This program is designed to manage character data in the simulated game **FC24** using the **Array** data structure and associated algorithms. It demonstrates working with various data types and performing operations on Arrays in Java.

## Key Features
1. **INPUT**  
   - Add character data into an Array and display it in a table format.
   - Validate user input to ensure correctness before adding data.

2. **INSERT**  
   - Insert new character data at a specified position in the Array (starting from index 0).
   - Utilizes the Insert algorithm to update the Array.

3. **TRAVERSAL**  
   - Traverse through the Array and display all character data in a TextArea.

4. **SORT**  
   - Sort characters based on their **Rating** value in ascending order.
   - Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.

5. **SEARCH**  
   - Search for a character by name.
   - Displays the character's information in a TextArea if found; otherwise, displays "Not Found."
   - Uses the Linear Search algorithm.

6. **DELETE**  
   - Delete a character from a specified position in the Array (starting from index 0).
   - Uses the Delete algorithm and displays the deleted character's details.

## Data Fields
Each character in the game is represented by the following attributes:
- **ID** (Integer): Unique identifier for the character.
- **Name** (String): Name of the character.
- **Position** (String): Position of the character in the game.
- **Rating** (Integer): Power rating of the character.
- **Value** (Float): Monetary value of the character.
- **Team** (String): Team to which the character belongs.
