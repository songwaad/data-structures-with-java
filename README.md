# Data Structures with Java
This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Java as part of my learning journey in computer science. Each project demonstrates specific algorithms and data handling techniques tailored for practical applications.

## Projects
### 1. Arrays
A program for managing character data in the game **FC24**. Key functionalities include:
- Data traversal, insertion, deletion
- Sorting (Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Linear Search)
- Data representation in a table format

### 2. Stack
A program to reverse numerical sequences using **three stacks**. Features include:
- Customizable stack size
- Push and pop operations
- Error handling for invalid inputs and stack overflow

### 3. Queue
An application to manage the weight inspection of trucks. Features include:
- Categorization of trucks by type and weight limits
- Queue management with a maximum capacity of 10
- Fine calculation for overweight trucks

### 4. Linked List (Doubly Linked List)
A program for managing character data in **FC24** using doubly linked lists. Key functionalities include:
- Traversing forward and backward
- Insertion after a specific node
- Node deletion and searching by name
