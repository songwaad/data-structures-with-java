# Character Management Program for FC24 (Doubly Linked List)

This program simulates a character management system for the game **FC24**, implemented using the **Doubly Linked List** data structure. It allows users to perform various operations on character data, such as inserting, traversing, searching, and deleting nodes.

## Key Features
1. **Input (Insert at Head)**  
   - Allows users to input character data and add it to the beginning of the linked list.
   - Validates input to ensure completeness and accuracy.

2. **Insert After a Specific Node**  
   - Adds a new character node after a specified node, determined by the character's name (using the SEARCH function).
   - Alerts users if the specified node is not found.

3. **Traversal**  
   - Supports two types of traversal:
     - **Forward Traversing**: From the head to the tail of the list.
     - **Backward Traversing**: From the tail to the head of the list.

4. **Search by Name**  
   - Finds a node by the character's name and displays the character's information.
   - If the character is not found, it shows a "Not Found" message.

5. **Delete Node**  
   - Deletes a node from the list based on the character's name.
   - Displays the details of the deleted character.
   - Alerts users if the character is not found.
